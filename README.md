## Motivation
  
  Was captivated by the simiplicity of the game CODENAMES during lockdown, fully enjoyed the game and believe it serves as a great stepping stone to produce quality REACT code using multiple REACT hooks. Also a lovely game to play with a group!
  
## Issues
  - Website requires responsive design for different viewports.
  - Turn management conflicts with the backend API storage.
